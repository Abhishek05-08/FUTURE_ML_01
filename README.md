# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship task. The goal is to *predict future retail sales trends* using historical transaction data and present insights in an *interactive Power BI dashboard*.  
It combines *Python (Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib)* for data cleaning & forecasting with *Power BI* for visualization.

   - Cleaned historical sales data.  
   - Removed missing values & standardized columns.  
   - Created features like daily totals, rolling averages.  

2. *Forecasting (Prophet Model in Python)*  
   - Built a time series forecasting model.  
   - Generated sales predictions for the upcoming months.  
   - Exported results to Excel for dashboard integration.  

3. *Dashboard (Power BI)*  
   - Visualized actual vs forecasted sales.  
   - Added KPIs (Total Sales, Avg per Transaction, etc.).
